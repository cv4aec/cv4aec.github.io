Computer Vision In The Built Environment For The Design, Construction and Operation of Buildings</strong> organized at <img class="emoji" title=":wave:" alt=":wave:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f44b.png" height="20" width="20"> <a href="https://cvpr.thecvf.com/"><img class="rounded-rect" src="assets/imgs/cvpr2021.jpg" width="400px" alt="cvpr2021"></a></p>

<p>The workshop will connect the domains of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) with that of Computer Vision by establishing a common ground of interaction and identify shared research interests. These topics will be presented from the dual lens of Computer Vision and AEC, highlighting the limitations and bottlenecks related to developing applications for this specific domain. The objective is for the two communities to come together and solve problems that are relevant in the AEC community, such as understanding the construction sites as it is changing, as well as automatically generating building models from scans of real data.</p>

<p>This workshop will also host the <strong>2nd International Scan-to-BIM competition</strong> challenge focused on key problems when converting 3D point cloud data obtained using lidar, photogrammetry, or depth map cameras to Building Information Models (BIMs). BIMs represent different elements of a building in a semantically rich manner, identifying objects, associated attributes, and geometrical and topological relationships. AEC firms and public agencies create BIMs to design new buildings and other structures; however, BIMs are rarely available for existing buildings or facilities. For maintenance, retrofitting, or renovation AEC entities could greatly benefit from access to BIMs of their facilities, because interpreting 2D as-built drawings is very time consuming and leads to many errors and omissions. Furthermore, asset owners could use BIMs for operations and maintenance as BIMs enable storing and having access to attributes such as maintenance history, material type, manufacturer specifications among others.</p>

<p>However, current computer vision evaluations are mainly done on familiar evaluation metrics such as Intersection-over-Union (IoU) or classification accuracy, rather than metrics that are more relevant in practice in the AEC community, such as geometrical and topological connections between different spaces and openings. This challenge aims to bring the computer vision, civil engineering, geomatics, and construction communities together by creating new tasks and evaluation metrics that can be tackled by computer vision researchers while being of interest to and fulfilling the objectives of the AEC community.</p>

<p>The workshop will therefore consist of two parts: invited <a href="#speakers" target="_self">keynote talks</a> and a  <a href="#challenge" target="_self">Scan-to-BIM challenge</a>.</p>

</h2>
<p>The workshop will host the 4th International Scan-to-BIM challenge. The challenge will include the following tasks:</p>

<p>I. 2D Floorplan Reconstruction <br>
II. 3D Building Model Reconstruction</p>

<p class="text-center"><strong>[<a href="https://github.com/GradientSpaces/cv4aec-challenge">GitHub</a>]</strong></p>

<p>The dataset is available via email. You will need a registered account to download the dataset. Once you submit a request for registration, it will be inspected and a registration link will be sent to you within 24 hours. The challenge contains a total of 31 buildings with multiple floors each and dozens of rooms on each floor. Of which, 20 buildings are designated as the training set, with a total of 49 point clouds. The validation and testing sets contain 5.5 buildings with 21 point clouds each. For each model, there is a point cloud in LAZ format. For the training and validation sets, a corresponding floorplan aligned with the coordinate system of the point cloud is also provided.</p>

<h3 id="2d-floor-plan-reconstruction">2D Floor Plan Reconstruction</h3>

<p>Tthe training set consists of the point clouds of 20 buildings with multiple floors each, with a total of 49 point clouds, as well as corresponding 2D building models for each floor with multiple extracted layers. These layers include: walls, curved walls, doors, windows, stairs, and columns. The buildings have complicated floor structures which could include dozens of rooms, curved walls and many doors on each floor. We have released 6 new buildings as the validation set and another 6 as the testing set. The validation set contains point clouds and their corresponding 2D building models. For the testing set, only the point clouds will be made available, while the 2D building models will not be made available and we will host a server to evaluate the submissions. We include metrics to evaluate the reconstruction of the walls, doors, and columns, as well as floor area in 2D :</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Geometric Metrics</strong> <br>
 a. <em>IoU</em> of each room (a room is defined as a completely separated area with walls and doors). <br>
 b. <em>Accuracy of endpoints</em> : Precision/Recall at 3 different thresholds: 5cm, 10cm and 20cm, as well as the F-measure at each threshold will be evaluated in the coordinate system of the point cloud. The provided endpoints will be matched with the Hungarian algorithm to the point cloud, and every point that is within a certain threshold will be determined as a match. <br>
 c. <em>Orientation</em> For each matched line between the ground truth, we will compute the cosine similarity metric between them as the normalized dot product. If a line is not matched with ground truth, the cosine metric will be zero. Finally, the metric will be averaged over all the ground truth lines.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Topological Metrics</strong> <br>
 a. <em><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5539950">Warping error</a></em> : The warping error will first warp the predicted floorplan to the ground truth with a homotopic deformation, and then compute the pixels that cannot match after the deformation. <br>
 b. <strong><em>Betti number error</em></strong> : The Betti number error will compare the Betti numbers between the prediction and the ground truth and output the absolute value of the difference.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="3d-building-model-reconstruction">3D Building Model Reconstruction</h3>

<p>The training set consists of point clouds of 4 buildings with multiple floors, as well as the corresponding 3D building model in AutoCAD DXF format. We aim to release 2 more buildings for the validation set and 2 more as the testing set. For 3D, because of the difficulty to come up with correct ground truth and have a consistent file format that is acceptable to both the computer vision and AEC communities, we have decided that we will use an expert panel to evaluate the submissions manually. We will aim to have automatic evaluations for the challenges in next years.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In our JSON format, we provide walls as middle lines + thickness. The middle lines will connect to each other at corners. Hence there is no ambiguity on which part of the corner belongs to which wall.
We would like to note that ALL the submissions <strong>need to be constructed automatically</strong>. Manual reconstructions are against the spirit of this challenge and will not be allowed.</p>
