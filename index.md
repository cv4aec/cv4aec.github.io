</p>

This workshop bridges the fields of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) with Computer Vision by focusing on how construction, the most dynamic, data-rich, and physically grounded phase of the built environment, can inform the way we design. Construction sites continuously evolve in geometry, appearance, and topology, offering a uniquely challenging yet structured setting for advancing computer vision tasks such as spatiotemporal modeling, semantic reasoning, and multimodal understanding. At the same time, the representations learned from construction data --- capturing how things are actually built, changed, and adapted --- can feed back into design processes, informing more generative, data-driven, and sustainable decision-making.

The workshop explores how visual and multimodal data, including 3D scans, imagery, sensor streams, and language, can be used to model and predict the evolution of the built environment and inspire generative frameworks that translate these insights into actionable design knowledge. The goal is to connect bottom-up scene understanding with top-down design generation, effectively closing the loop between "as-built" and "as-designed." Construction thus becomes not only an application domain but also an experimental testbed for foundational computer vision research --- providing real-world complexity, scale, and temporal dynamics rarely captured in synthetic datasets.

Through paper submissions, keynote talks, and the **Nothing Stands Still** construction-data challenge, participants will engage with real-world, challenging testbeds that advance spatiotemporal 3D modeling, multimodal understanding, and semantic reasoning of evolving scenes in core vision research.

The workshop will consist of: invited <a href="#speakers" target="_self">keynote talks</a>, <a href="#papers" target="_self">paper submissions</a>, and the <a href="#challenge" target="_self">Nothing Stands Still Challenge</a>.

## :paperclip: **Call for Papers** {#papers}

We invite submissions exploring the intersection of Computer Vision and the Built Environment, focusing on applications that transform how we understand, model, and design buildings and construction sites. Construction sites and building lifecycles are dynamic, complex, and data-rich, providing an ideal real-world testbed for advancing computer vision methods while generating actionable insights for design, sustainability, and circular practices.

Both **short non-archival papers (4 pages)** and **long archival papers (8 pages)** are welcome. Submissions should:
- Introduce the topic and review related literature.
- Present methodology, experiments, and results.
- Situate the work in the context of real-world AEC applications, highlighting potential improvements over current practice.
- Include discussion of practical, ethical, and organizational considerations, when relevant.

The best two long archival papers and the best short non-archival paper will be presented during the workshop in the Oral Presentation session.

We also accept papers submitted to the main conference and accepted as long non-archival papers (8 pages). Please indicate on the manuscript submission that it is accepted at the main conference.

<strong>Topics</strong> include but are not limited to:
- Generative design and predictive modeling, including those informed by evolving data or other physical constraints.
- Floorplan reconstruction, indoor layout synthesis, and 3D scene generation.
- Activity recognition on construction sites or within occupied buildings.
- Semantic 3D/4D understanding for construction monitoring, renovation, or modular design related tasks.
- Large-scale 3D reconstruction of evolving sites and temporally dynamic environments.
- Material, component, and object understanding to support reuse and circular economy practices.
- Object and scene localization, mapping, scene completion, and change detection across evolving phases.
- Multimodal integration of 3D geometry, imagery, sensors, and text-based documentation to inform design and operational decisions.

Each submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members, chosen to provide complementary expertise across computer vision and AEC domains.

## :checkered_flag: **Nothing Stands Still Challenge** {#challenge}

The workshop will host the **2026 Nothing Stands Still (NSS) Dataset Challenge**, introducing a unique real-world testbed for computer vision research. Previously run as part of a robotics conference workshop, the NSS challenge is now joining the computer vision community for the first time, reflecting its relevance for understanding complex, dynamic environments at scale. Full details from prior challenges are available at: **[nothing-stands-still.com/challenge](https://nothing-stands-still.com/challenge)**

The challenge focuses on **spatiotemporal 3D point cloud registration** of evolving construction sites, which feature dramatic changes in geometry, topology, and appearance over time. These dynamic environments make construction sites an ideal testbed for cutting-edge computer vision tasks, including scene reconstruction, semantic understanding, predictive modeling, and temporal reasoning. To expand the scope of the challenge, we aim to add semantic annotations, enabling participants to reason not only about geometry but also about functional elements, building components, and how they evolve over time.

<!-- ![NSS Benchmark](assets/imgs/nss_benchmark.png) -->
<!-- *Figure 1. The Nothing Stands Still benchmark evaluates both pairwise and multi-way spatiotemporal 3D point cloud registration.* -->

### Evaluation

- **Spatiotemporal registration task:** Submissions will be evaluated using a **global RMSE metric**, providing a standardized measure for comparing performance across methods.
- **Spatiotemporal semantic understanding task:** Methods will be evaluated on standard segmentation metrics, as well as temporal counterparts.

### Challenge Timeline

| Milestone | Date |
|-----------|------|
| Dataset Release & Registration Opens | January 15, 2026 |
| Submission Window Opens (evaluation server live) | February 15, 2026 |
| Submission Deadline | April 30, 2026 |
| Review & Evaluation | April 30 -- May 4, 2026 |
| Notification of Challenge Winners | May 5, 2026 |
| Workshop Presentation & Awards | TBD |

> **Ethical Note:** All construction sites in the dataset are located in North America, which may limit the generalization of models trained on this data. Participants are encouraged to consider methods for robust and fair modeling across varied environments.

By combining dynamic geometry, large-scale scene evolution, and future semantic reasoning, the NSS challenge offers the CV community a rigorous, high-impact platform to test algorithms in scenarios that closely mimic real-world challenges in construction, renovation, and modular building reuse --- bridging the gap between technical innovation and tangible societal impact.
